# 🚗 Ownership Cost Forecasting for Pre-Owned Cars  

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to forecast the **total ownership cost** of pre-owned cars over a specified period. By leveraging **historical used car data** (including sales prices, mileage, maintenance records, and depreciation trends), the model aims to assist buyers, sellers, and dealers in understanding long-term cost implications.  

The implementation is done using **Python** in **Google Colab**, with a complete **end-to-end ML workflow** from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.

## 📌 Project Objectives  
- Forecast **ownership cost** of pre-owned cars over time.  
- Analyze key determinants of used car value (mileage, brand, year of manufacture, etc.).  
- Implement a **Linear Regression** model for cost prediction.  
- Provide **visual insights** using scatter plots, box plots, and time-series charts.  
- Demonstrate a **foundational regression pipeline** for automotive valuation contexts.
