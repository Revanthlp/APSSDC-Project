# üöó Ownership Cost Forecasting for Pre-Owned Cars  

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to forecast the **total ownership cost** of pre-owned cars over a specified period. By leveraging **historical used car data** (including sales prices, mileage, maintenance records, and depreciation trends), the model aims to assist buyers, sellers, and dealers in understanding long-term cost implications.  

The implementation is done using **Python** in **Google Colab**, with a complete **end-to-end ML workflow** from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.

## üìå Project Objectives  
- Forecast **ownership cost** of pre-owned cars over time.  
- Analyze key determinants of used car value (mileage, brand, year of manufacture, etc.).  
- Implement a **Linear Regression** model for cost prediction.  
- Provide **visual insights** using scatter plots, box plots, and time-series charts.  
- Demonstrate a **foundational regression pipeline** for automotive valuation contexts.

## üîé Methodology  

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Import dataset (CSV/Excel).  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., brand, fuel type).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Scatter plots ‚Üí Mileage vs Price.  
   - Box plots ‚Üí Brand vs Ownership Cost.  
   - Time-series ‚Üí Depreciation over years.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Derive age of car from manufacturing year.  
   - Combine financial attributes into ownership cost.  

4. **Model Implementation**  
   - Train-Test Split.  
   - Apply **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.  
   - Evaluate with **RMSE** and **R¬≤ score**.  

5. **Visualization & Interpretation**  
   - Residual plots to assess prediction accuracy.  
   - Importance of features in cost forecasting.
