# 🚗 Ownership Cost Forecasting for Pre-Owned Cars  

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to forecast the **total ownership cost** of pre-owned cars over a specified period. By leveraging **historical used car data** (including sales prices, mileage, maintenance records, and depreciation trends), the model aims to assist buyers, sellers, and dealers in understanding long-term cost implications.  

The implementation is done using **Python** in **Google Colab**, with a complete **end-to-end ML workflow** from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.  

---

## 📌 Project Objectives  
- Forecast **ownership cost** of pre-owned cars over time.  
- Analyze key determinants of used car value (mileage, brand, year of manufacture, etc.).  
- Implement a **Linear Regression** model for cost prediction.  
- Provide **visual insights** using scatter plots, box plots, and time-series charts.  
- Demonstrate a **foundational regression pipeline** for automotive valuation contexts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Data Analysis → `pandas`, `numpy`  
  - Visualization → `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - Machine Learning → `scikit-learn`

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes information such as:  
- **Car Attributes:** Brand, Model, Year, Mileage, Fuel Type, Transmission  
- **Financials:** Sale Price, Maintenance Cost, Insurance Cost  
- **Depreciation Trends:** Historical values based on car age  

Dataset: (https://github.com/Revanthlp/APSSDC-Project/blob/main/pre_owned_cars_synthetic_dataset.csv)

## 🔎 Methodology  

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Import dataset (CSV/Excel).  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., brand, fuel type).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Scatter plots → Mileage vs Price.  
   - Box plots → Brand vs Ownership Cost.  
   - Time-series → Depreciation over years.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Derive age of car from manufacturing year.  
   - Combine financial attributes into ownership cost.  

4. **Model Implementation**  
   - Train-Test Split.  
   - Apply **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.  
   - Evaluate with **RMSE** and **R² score**.  

5. **Visualization & Interpretation**  
   - Residual plots to assess prediction accuracy.  
   - Importance of features in cost forecasting.

## 📈 Results

* **Performance Metrics:**

  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): *value here*
  * R² Score: *value here*

* **Key Insights:**

  * Mileage and brand significantly affect ownership cost.
  * Cars depreciate faster in the first few years.
  * Premium brands maintain higher resale values.

---

## 📌 Future Work

* Implement more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Integrate live car pricing APIs.
* Extend model to predict resale value for *electric and hybrid* cars.
* Build a **web app dashboard** for end-users.
